# DNA Sequence Analysis-Bioinformatics Project

# Overview
This project is a DNA analysis tool implemented in Python. It provides several functions for processing and analyzing DNA sequences. The main features include:

Cleaning the sequence to remove unwanted characters.
Calculating the GC content (percentage of G and C bases).
Generating the reverse complement of the DNA sequence.
Transcribing the DNA sequence into mRNA.
The project is designed to work with DNA sequence data stored in text files.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.x

# File Structure
The repository contains the following files:
dna_analysis.py: The Python script for DNA analysis.
sample_sequence.txt: A sample text file containing a DNA sequence (modify as needed for your input).
README.md: Documentation for the project.

# Expected Output:

The script will output the cleaned DNA sequence.
It will calculate and print the GC content (as a percentage).
It will generate and print the reverse complement of the DNA sequence.
It will transcribe the DNA sequence into mRNA.
